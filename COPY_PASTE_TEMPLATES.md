### **TEMPLATE 1: General (Use for Austin, Seattle, Denver, Boston, Chicago)**

**Title:**
```
I built an AI rental assistant after wasting 18 hours apartment hunting - Beta testers needed
```

**Body:**
```
Hey [city] renters!

I just spent 18 HOURS last week trying to find an apartment. Scrolling through Zillow, Apartments.com, Craigslist... filling out the same application 8 times... waiting days just to get a "sorry, already rented" message.

I was so frustrated that I built an AI rental assistant to help people like us navigate this mess.

**What it does:**
- Helps you understand what you actually need (vs what you think you need)
- Explains the application process clearly (no more confusion)
- Guides you on documents, requirements, and next steps
- Gives realistic advice when you get rejected
- Saves you HOURS of research and confusion

**What it DOESN'T do (yet):**
- No live listings (coming soon)
- Doesn't submit applications for you
- Not a landlord or property manager

I'm in BETA and need testers to help me make this actually useful. It's 100% free right now.

**Try it:** rentalai.homes

Takes 2 minutes. No signup required. Just chat with it and tell me if it's helpful or total garbage.

**Feedback welcome!** What features would actually help you find a rental faster?

P.S. - If this helps you, please share it! Every renter deserves to spend less time on this nightmare.

### **TEMPLATE 2: Problem-Focused (Alternative)**

**Title:**
```
The rental search process is broken. I built something to help. [Free Beta]
```

**Body:**
```
Real talk: Finding an apartment in [CITY] shouldn't take 20+ hours.

**The problems we all face:**
- Spend 2-3 hours comparing listings manually
- Wait 24-48 hours just to schedule a viewing
- Upload same documents to every property
- Apply and pray with zero feedback
- No idea why we got rejected

**What if AI could help with this?**

I just launched a beta of an AI rental assistant. It's like having a knowledgeable friend who's been through the process helping you figure out:
- What you actually need vs what you think you need
- What documents landlords want (and why)
- How to improve your chances of approval
- What to do when you get rejected
- Realistic expectations for [CITY] rental market

**It's free while in beta.** No signup, no BS.

Try it: rentalai.homes

I need honest feedback from real renters. Is this helpful? Is it trash? What's missing?

Drop your thoughts here or in the chat. Thanks!

## 💬 COMMON RESPONSES

When people comment:

**"Does it have live listings?"**
```
Not yet! That's Phase 2. Right now it helps with the process, documents, and strategy. But listings are definitely on the roadmap if people find this valuable. What would you want to see in a listings feature?
```

**"Why would I use this vs just googling?"**
```
Fair question! The AI remembers your specific situation (budget, pets, timeline) and gives personalized guidance. It's like having a friend who's been through it help you. But you're right - if Googling works for you, stick with it! I'm just trying to save people time.
```

**"This is an ad"**
```
You're right, it technically is. I'm being upfront that I built it and need testers. It's free during beta. If people find it valuable, I'll charge for premium features later. But right now I genuinely just need feedback. No tricks.
```

**"How do you make money?"**
```
Not making money yet! It's free beta. If it works well, I'll add paid features (like live listings, auto-applications, viewing scheduling). But basic help will stay free. I'm testing if this is even useful first.
```

**"Is my data private?"**
```
Good question! Conversations are stored to improve the AI, but nothing is sold or shared. No accounts required, no emails collected unless you opt in for beta updates. Privacy policy: [link to your privacy page]
